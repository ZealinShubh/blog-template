        <p class="font1">The Flash is a 2023 American superhero film based on the DC character of the same name. Produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, DC Studios, Double Dream, and the Disco Factory, and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is the 13th installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film is directed by Andy Muschietti from a screenplay by Christina Hodson and stars Ezra Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash alongside Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon, Ron Livingston, Maribel Verd√∫, Kiersey Clemons, Antje Traue, and Michael Keaton. In the film, Barry travels back in time to prevent his mother's death, which brings unintended consequences.
        <br>
        Development of a feature film based on the Flash began in the late 1980s, with multiple writers anddirectors attached to the project through 2014. The film was then redeveloped as a part of the DCEU,with Miller cast as the title character. Multiple directors were attached to the film over thefollowing years, with Seth Grahame-Smith, Rick Famuyiwa, and the duo of John Francis Daley and JonathanGoldstein all departing the project over creative differences. Muschietti and Hodson joined the film inJuly 2019, and pre-production began in January 2020. The film is influenced by the comic book storylineFlashpoint (2011), featuring other DC characters, such as Calle's Supergirl and both Ben Affleck's andKeaton's versions of Batman. Principal photography took place from April to October 2021 at WarnerBros. Studios, Leavesden and on location around the United Kingdom.
